## Interdependence

-   My best choice depends on your best response

## Some assumptions

-   Organisms have preferences for some outcomes over others

-   They seek their preferred outcomes

-   We can define these preferences with numbers @bowling2023

## Some math

Utility

:   The ***utility*** of an action is a function, $U(s, a)$ that takes states ($s_1, s_2, ...$) and ($s_1, s_2, ...$) returns a number from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

$$
\begin{align}
U(a_1) &= 1.5 \\
U(a_2) &= 2.0
\end{align}
$$

All else equal, organisms choose actions with the highest *expected* utility for themselves.

$$
E[U(a_1)] < E[U(a_2)]
$$

## Some caveats

-   Probably evolved through natural selection, but not necessary to assume here (you do you)

-   But sometimes they make mistakes

## A puzzle

-   Social factors are well documented for suicide

-   A high proportion of attempts and deaths are immediately preceeded

## Interdependence

## Three phenomena

-   Suicidal behavior
-   Non-suicidal self-harm (NSSI)
-   Self-injurious behavior (SIB)

## Scientific silos

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **SIB** | PDD, ID | ABA |
| **NSSI** | Neurotypical adolescents | C&A Psychology |
| **Suicidal behavior** | Neurotypical 15+ | Adult clinical psych, psychiatry, epidemiology |

## ABA and NSSI / Suicide?

-   Actual suicidal behavior plainly too infrequent (1-2x per lifetime)

-   NSSI not (ethically) prompt-able in clinical setting

[@rizvi2008]

## Clinical Psych / MDs and SIB?

-   Not often set up for contemporaneous self-harm

-   Even primarily "behavioral" techniques (exposure) are heavily verbal

-   Overall, ABA seems to have that under control...

## Suicide vs NSSI research?

-   Suicide reviewers: NSSI is not real suicidal behavior

-   NSSI researchers: well, we never wanted to be in your club anyway

-   IRB: do you want to do this study the easy way or the hard way (asking about suicide)

-   DSM-5: we're probably going to make these different codes

## And don't even bring up drug overdoses!

![](overdoses.jpg){fig-align="center" width="1200"}

-   **Nonsuicidal overdoses** were defined as intentional overdoses where the person states that they had no intention of dying *from the overdose*

[@fox2016]

## Intuitive topographical similarities

-   Self-inflicted tissue damage
-   70% of teens with NSSI reported a historic attempt @nock2006

## What about functional similarities?

-   XXX say something about automatic reinformcenet

-   Social functions

## Social functions in SIB

Consider two inclusive reviews of functional analyses

-   50 years of research (1961 - 2012)

-   445 studies

-   981 distinct FAs
